Create a clean HTML5 structure using semantic elements.  
**Key Concepts:**  
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration  
- `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>` usage  
- Navigation links for internal structure  

---

### **Task 1: SEO and Accessibility Meta Tags**
**File:** `1-index.html`  
**Objective:**  
Add essential meta tags to improve **SEO**, **responsiveness**, and **page identification**.  
**Added Elements:**  
- `<meta charset="utf-8">`  
- `<meta name="description">`  
- `<meta name="keywords">`  
- `<meta name="author">`  
- `<meta name="viewport">`  
- `<title>Semantic Html Blog Post</title>`

---

### **Task 2: Blog Post Layout**
**File:** `2-index.html`  
**Objective:**  
Enhance the page with a **blog-style layout** using semantic elements.  
**Key Additions:**  
- Nested `<header>` inside `<article>` for blog title and date.  
- Three `<section>` elements for Introduction, Main Content, and Conclusion.  
- `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for image illustration.  
- `<footer>` inside `<article>` for author and publish date.  

---

### **Task 3: Accessible Form with ARIA Roles**
**File:** `3-index.html`  
**Objective:**  
Improve accessibility using **ARIA roles and attributes** in a form.  
**Form Features:**
- `role="form"` and `aria-labelledby` for assistive technologies.  
- Labeled `<input>` fields with `aria-required="true"`.
